# BingoSyncHighlighter

A Hollow Knight mod allowing highlighting goals on a BingoSync board. Requires the BingoSync mod.
By default, you can highlight goals on a board by:
-pressing NumPad0
-pressing a NumPad key corresponding to the row you want to mark
-pressing a NumPad key corresponding to the column you want to mark

In the mod settings, you can switch to using normal number keys, or allowing both kinds of number keys.
In the mod settings file (BingoSyncHighligher.GlobalSettings.json in your Hollow Knight folder) you can set a custom activation key (i.e. NumPad0/number 0 replacement) using its Unity KeyCode name.
